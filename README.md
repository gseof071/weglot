# Weglot Translate Your Website Instantly: AI-Powered Translation, SEO-Ready, Multilingual in Minutes

So you've got a website. It's doing okay. Maybe even great. But here's the thing—you're leaving money on the table if you're only speaking one language.

Think about it. Your potential customers in Spain, France, Japan, or Brazil? They're scrolling right past your site because it's all in English. Not because your product sucks, but because they literally can't understand what you're selling.

Enter Weglot. It's one of those rare tools that actually does what it promises without making you pull your hair out.

## What Weglot Actually Does (Without the Marketing Fluff)

Weglot translates your entire website into 110+ languages. Not manually, character by character like some medieval monk. We're talking AI-powered, instant translation that you can tweak if needed.

The setup? Five minutes. Maybe ten if you're distracted by cat videos.

You add Weglot to your site, pick your languages, and boom—your website is suddenly speaking French, German, Japanese, whatever. The translations appear on language-specific URLs (like yoursite.com/fr/ for French), which Google loves for SEO purposes.

Here's what makes it different from Google Translate's clunky widget: Weglot uses top-tier AI engines like DeepL, Google Translate, and Microsoft Translator for the initial layer. Then you can edit everything through a visual editor, collaborate with your team, or order professional human translations if you want that extra polish.

Plus—and this is the part that actually matters—it handles all the technical SEO stuff automatically. Hreflang tags, translated metadata, language-specific URLs. All the boring but essential things that make Google show your Spanish page to Spanish speakers and your English page to English speakers.

## The New AI Language Model Feature

Here's something fresh: Weglot rolled out a custom AI Language Model feature in 2025 that learns your brand voice. You can train it on your glossary, past edits, and style preferences so the translations actually sound like you, not some robot trying to sound professional.

You pick a tone (informal, neutral, formal) and specify your audience (general, technical, non-technical). The AI learns from your corrections and gets better over time. More than 80% of Weglot users apparently don't even need to edit their AI translations anymore, which tells you something about the quality.

## Pricing That Makes Sense (Mostly)

Let's talk money because that's what everyone really wants to know.

| Plan | Monthly Price | Annual Price | Translated Words | Languages | Best For |
|------|--------------|--------------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | $0 | 2,000 | 1 | Testing, tiny sites, landing pages |
| **Starter** | $17 | ~$170/year | 10,000 | 1 | Small blogs, portfolios |
| **Business** | $47 | ~$470/year | 50,000 | 3 | Growing businesses |
| **Pro** | $87 | ~$870/year | 200,000 | 5 | Agencies, e-commerce stores |
| **Advanced** | $329 | ~$3,290/year | 1,000,000 | 10 | Large websites |
| **Extended** | $769 | ~$7,690/year | 5,000,000 | 20 | Enterprise sites |

The pricing is based on two things: how many words you need to translate and how many languages. If you pick an annual plan, you get 2 extra months free, which is basically a 17% discount.

Here's the catch: "translated words" means total words across all languages. So if you have a 10,000-word website and translate it into 3 languages, that's 30,000 translated words total. Do the math before you commit.

## What Users Actually Say

The Trustpilot reviews sit at 5 stars, which is suspiciously high, but when you dig into the actual comments, people seem genuinely happy. Common themes:

**The Good Stuff:**
- Setup is genuinely fast and simple
- Customer support responds quickly (often within minutes on workdays)
- The visual editor is intuitive
- Automatic translation quality is better than expected
- Works smoothly with WordPress, Shopify, Webflow, and basically everything else

**The Complaints:**
- Pricing gets expensive fast if you have a large site or many languages
- Some users hit unexpected auto-upgrades (though you can turn this off)
- Occasionally words that aren't visible on pages still get counted toward your limit
- The translation quality, while good, still needs human review for polished, brand-aligned content

One user from January 2026 called out an unauthorized upgrade issue, which Weglot apparently fixed after escalation. Another mentioned that while the free trial worked perfectly, they exceeded their word limit quickly after upgrading.

## Who Should Actually Use Weglot?

**Perfect for:**
- E-commerce stores expanding internationally
- SaaS companies targeting multiple markets
- Marketing websites that need multilingual SEO
- WordPress/Shopify sites that want a plug-and-play solution
- Anyone who values their time more than manually copying content into Google Translate

**Maybe not for:**
- Massive enterprise sites with millions of words (unless you have the budget)
- Sites that need 20+ languages with massive word counts (check competitors)
- People who want 100% control over every translation detail without using Weglot's interface

## The Integration Story

Weglot works with basically everything. WordPress? There's a plugin. Shopify? There's an app. Webflow, Wix, Squarespace, custom sites? Yep, yep, yep.

For WordPress specifically, the plugin has over 70,000+ active installations and integrates seamlessly with WooCommerce, Elementor, Yoast SEO, and other popular tools. You literally just install it, enter your API key, select your languages, and you're done.

The language switcher gets added automatically to your site so visitors can switch languages with one click. You can customize where it appears and how it looks to match your design.

## SEO Benefits That Actually Matter

Here's where Weglot shines: it follows Google's multilingual SEO best practices by default.

Each translated page gets its own URL (subdirectory or subdomain structure). Hreflang tags are added automatically to tell search engines which language version to show. Metadata gets translated so your titles and descriptions appear correctly in search results.

According to a study Weglot published, websites with translations get 327% more visibility in Google AI Overviews and ChatGPT. That's not marketing hype—translated content genuinely helps you reach people who search in other languages.

## Professional Translation Options

If you need human-quality translations for important pages, Weglot lets you order professional translations directly from the dashboard. Just select the strings or pages you want translated, and within 48-72 hours, they're integrated into your site.

You can also invite your own translators to the platform, set glossary rules for consistent terminology, and use the visual editor to refine translations in context.

## Current Promo Codes and Discounts

👉 **WPBEG19** - Get 15% OFF all plans (valid through 2026)  
👉 **[Claim your discount here](https://www.weglot.com)**

If you sign up for annual plans, you automatically get 2 extra months free on top of any promo code discounts. The 14-day free trial doesn't require a credit card, so you can test everything before committing.

Some partner sites are offering 20% discounts for the first year, but these are typically gated behind signup forms. The standard 15% discount code above works across all plans and can be applied at checkout.

## The Verdict

Weglot is expensive compared to doing translations manually or using free Google Translate widgets. But it saves you weeks of work and actually gets the technical SEO right, which matters if you want international traffic that converts.

The AI translation quality in 2026 is legitimately good. Not perfect, but good enough that most users don't need to edit much. The new AI Language Model that adapts to your brand voice is a nice touch.

If you're serious about reaching international audiences and you value your time, Weglot is worth the investment. Start with the 14-day free trial, test it on your actual site, and see if the automated workflow justifies the cost for your situation.

For small sites under 2,000 words, the free plan works forever. For growing businesses, expect to pay $47-$87/month. For larger operations, budget $300-$700/month depending on your word count and language needs.
